This work presents a comparative analysis of the object models of modern programming languages, 
including C\#, C++, Golang, Java, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, Smalltalk, and Zonnon. 
The relevance of the study is justified by the widespread adoption of the object-oriented paradigm and 
the significant diversity in its implementation, which complicates the conscious selection of technologies and 
architectural solutions. The aim of the research is to identify the similarities, differences, 
strengths, and weaknesses of various object models, and based on this analysis, to develop proposals for 
an enhanced model. As a result of the study, the theoretical foundations of object models are systematized, 
a detailed examination of their implementation in the selected languages is conducted, identifying application 
domains and common pitfalls, and an original model integrating best practices is proposed. The practical 
significance of the work lies in the fact that its results can be used by developers for selecting languages 
and paradigms, and by architects for system design.
