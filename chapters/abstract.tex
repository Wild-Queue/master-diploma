This work conducts a systematic comparison of the object models in ten modern programming languages:
C\#, C++, Golang, Java, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, Smalltalk, and Zonnon. 
The research is motivated by the operational challenges faced by software engineers when 
choosing technologies given the significant differences in how object models 
are implemented in different language ecosystems. The main objective of the research is to 
identify the similarities, differences, strengths, and weaknesses of various object models, 
and based on this analysis, to develop proposals for an enhanced model. As a result of the study, 
the theoretical foundations of models are systematized, a detailed examination of their implementation 
in the selected languages is conducted, identifying application domains and common pitfalls, and an original 
model integrating best practices is proposed. The results obtained 
serve as a practical guide for developers when choosing a language and for software architects when designing 
object-oriented systems.
